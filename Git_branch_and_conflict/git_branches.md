it is like doing lots of work at a same time on a different environment without effetcing other's work environment.

Git branches provide same option 
it has a main or matser branch from where we can create other branches also to work on different projects whch will not affect any branches untill we merge it.

branches can craete on any branch either from main or from its childerns


There is a pointer which is called as a [head] it will always ponint to th head of the current working branch so that it can track whats going on on that file


# cmd
